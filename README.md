# Area 2071 Organisation Landing Page - 

This website was a PSD-to-HTML project to realize an original design from Dribbble, which can be found here for comparison: 

[Dribbble Area 2071 Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/3979326-Area-2071-Landing-Page)

A mobile version was not provided, and so the design was then modified so that the website is also completely mobile responsive and optimized for all device types.
